# Temperature Activated Door Lock

This Arduino-based project monitors ambient temperature using a TMP36 sensor and displays if the on a 128x64 OLED screen. If the temperature exceeds **80°F**, the system **activates a warning system** by flashing an LED and sounding a buzzer. Additionally, the lock mechanism (servo motor) will also react to the temperature, providing a simple automated response system. This automated response could potentially alert you to a fire and make escaping the building quicker.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Connect Power to the Bread Board**
        - 5V → Bread Board positive strip (+)
        - GND → Bread Board negative strip (-)

2. **Connect the TMP36 Temperature Sensor**  
   - VCC → 5V  
   - GND → GND  
   - Vout → A0

3. **Connect the 128x64 OLED Display (I2C)**  
   - VCC → 5V  
   - GND → GND  
   - SDA → A4  
   - SCL/SCK → A5

4. **Connect the LED**  
   - LED anode (+) → Digital Pin 13  
   - LED cathode (–) → Resistor → GND

5. **Connect the Piezo Buzzer**  
   - Positive → Digital Pin 12  
   - Negative → GND

6. **Connect the Servo Motor**  
   - Signal → Digital Pin 7  
   - Power → 5V  
   - GND → GND

7. **Upload the Arduino Code**  
   Use the Arduino IDE to upload your code to the Arduino Uno   R3.

## How It Works

- When the circuit is setting up the code, a fake company logo and name is displayed on the **OLED**.
- The **TMP36 sensor** continuously reads the ambient temperature.
- The temperature is converted to Fahrenheit and displayed on the **OLED screen**.
- If the temperature **exceeds 80°F**, the system:
  - **Flashes the LED**
  - **Sounds the buzzer**
  - **The servo motor unlocks**
- If the temperature is **below 80°F**, the system:
  - **OLED still displays the temperature**
  - **No alert is triggered**
  - **The servo motor locks**
